> 🚀 **Roadmap Note:** This project is designed to be the definitive "Swiss Army Knife" for competitive programming. **Currently, it features full Codeforces integration.** In future updates, we will be rolling out support for other online judges (such as AtCoder, LeetCode, CodeChef) along with additional tools to streamline your competitive programming workflow!

Solve Codeforces problems directly in VS Code — browse problems, join contests, run local tests, and track your progress without ever leaving the editor.

## Features

### Problem Explorer
- **Browse** all problems organized by **Rating** (12 ranges), **Tags** (top 30), **Solved**, and **Starred**
- **Daily Problem** — a fresh rating-appropriate challenge seeded daily
- **Smart Recommendations** — top 20 personalized suggestions based on your current rating
- Color-coded difficulty dots and green solved checkmarks
- Full-text search by problem name or ID
- Right-click context menu: Preview, Open on Codeforces, View Submissions, Mark/Unmark Solved, Star/Unstar

### Problem Preview
- Rich in-extension problem statement with time/memory limits, sample cases, tags, and rating
- **Open in Editor** — generates a ready-to-test solution file from your language template
- **Run Local Tests** button directly in the preview toolbar
- **Import Samples from Clipboard** — paste the Examples section from any Codeforces problem page

### Local Testing
- Dedicated **Test Results panel** with per-case pass/fail, diff view, input/output inspection, and rerun
- **Custom Test** — run against any input you type
- Supports C++, Python, Java, Kotlin, Rust, Go, C#, JavaScript


### Contest Explorer
- Upcoming, running, and recent contests with live countdowns in the sidebar and status bar
- **Contest Detail Panel** — opens inside VS Code showing your rank, rating change, hacks, and per-problem status
- **Standings Panel** — paginated standings with friends filter, opens from Contest Detail Panel
- `autoOpenContestProblems` setting: automatically opens all problem files when viewing a live contest
- Contest reminders before start (configurable lead time)
- One-click contest registration

### User Profile Dashboard
- Current rating, max rating, rank, contribution, and registration date
- **Current Streak** and **Longest Streak** — consecutive daily solve streaks
- Interactive **Rating Graph** with full contest history table
- Problems solved by rating bucket and top solved tags
- **Browse Solved Problems** — searchable, filterable panel with bar/pie rating chart, tag filter, sort, and export
- **Submissions History** view with verdict filtering (AC, WA, TLE, MLE, RTE, CE)

### Template Management
- Built-in paste-ready starters for all 8 supported languages
- **Edit Language Template** (`Codeforces: Edit Language Template`) — opens your template in VS Code; changes apply to all new solution files for that language
- **Reset Language Template to Default** — restores the built-in starter at any time
- Supports `{problemName}`, `{contestId}`, `{index}`, `{timeLimit}`, `{memoryLimit}` placeholders

## Solution File Layout

```
~/.codeforces/
├── problemset/
│   ├── 1A-Theatre_Square/
│   │   ├── cf_1A.cpp          ← your solution
│   │   ├── .problem.json      ← metadata (used by test runner)
│   │   ├── input1.txt
│   │   └── output1.txt
│   └── 1900A-Tricky_Template/
│       └── cf_1900A.cpp
└── templates/
    ├── template.cpp            ← your custom C++ template
    └── template.py
```

## API Authentication

For authenticated API features (e.g., richer profile analytics) you can optionally add API credentials:

1. Visit [Codeforces API settings](https://codeforces.com/settings/api)
2. Generate an API key + secret
3. Run `Codeforces: Configure API Credentials` or click the key icon in the Profile view toolbar

Credentials are stored securely in VS Code's **SecretStorage** — never in plain text.

---

## CodeLens Actions

When editing a solution file (`cf_*.cpp`, `cf_*.py`, etc.), action buttons appear at the top:

- **Run Tests** — run all sample test cases
- **Import Samples** — import from clipboard

---

## Troubleshooting

**Problem statement shows a fallback page (403)?**
Enable `codeforces.enableBrowserExtraction` and configure `codeforces.chromeExecutablePath`. The extension will open Chrome, let you complete any verification, then extract the statement automatically.


**Tests not running?**
Ensure the required compiler/interpreter is on your PATH. Check `codeforces.cppCompiler` and `codeforces.pythonCommand`.

**Profile stats not loading?**
Run `Codeforces: Refresh Profile Snapshot`. Stats require a successful API fetch of your recent submissions.
