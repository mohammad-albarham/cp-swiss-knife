> 🚀 **Roadmap Note:** This project is designed to be the definitive "Swiss Army Knife" for competitive programming. **Currently, it features full Codeforces integration.** In future updates, we will be rolling out support for other online judges (such as AtCoder, LeetCode, CodeChef) along with additional tools to streamline your competitive programming workflow!

Solve Codeforces problems directly in VS Code — browse problems, join contests, run local tests, and track your progress without ever leaving the editor.

## Features

### Problem Explorer

- Right-click context menu: Preview, Open on Codeforces, View Submissions, Mark/Unmark Solved, Star/Unstar

### Problem Preview
- Rich in-extension problem statement with time/memory limits, sample cases, tags, and rating
- **Open in Editor** — generates a ready-to-test solution file from your language template
- **Run Local Tests** button directly in the preview toolbar
- **Import Samples from Clipboard** — paste the Examples section from any Codeforces problem page

### Local Testing

![Local Testing Example](media/problem_test_example.png)

- Dedicated **Test Results panel** with per-case pass/fail, diff view, input/output inspection, and rerun

### User Profile Dashboard

![User Profile Dashboard Example](media/profile.png)

- Current rating, max rating, rank, contribution, and registration date
- **Current Streak** and **Longest Streak** — consecutive daily solve streaks
- Interactive **Rating Graph** with full contest history table
- Problems solved by rating bucket and top solved tags

  ![Browse Solved Problems Example](media/solved_problems.png)

- **Submissions History** view with verdict filtering (AC, WA, TLE, MLE, RTE, CE)

### Template Management
- Built-in paste-ready starters for all 8 supported languages
- **Edit Language Template** (`Codeforces: Edit Language Template`) — opens your template in VS Code; changes apply to all new solution files for that language
- **Reset Language Template to Default** — restores the built-in starter at any time
- Supports `{problemName}`, `{contestId}`, `{index}`, `{timeLimit}`, `{memoryLimit}` placeholders

## Getting Started

1. **Install** the extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
2. Open the **Codeforces** icon in the Activity Bar (left sidebar).
3. Click **Login** and enter your Codeforces handle.
4. *(Optional)* Click **Configure API Credentials** to enable authenticated API features.
5. Browse problems → click one to preview → click **Open in Editor** to start coding.
6. Press `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+T` to run local sample tests.


---
## API Authentication

For authenticated API features (e.g., richer profile analytics, viewing hacks during contests) you can optionally add your Codeforces API credentials:

1. Visit the [Codeforces API settings page](https://codeforces.com/settings/api).
2. Click **Add API key**.
3. You will be given a **Key** and a **Secret**.
4. Run `Codeforces: Configure API Credentials` in VS Code (or click the key icon in the Profile view toolbar).
5. Enter the **Key** when prompted, followed by the **Secret**.

> Credentials are stored securely in VS Code's **SecretStorage** — never in plain text.

## Solution File Layout

```
~/.codeforces/
├── problemset/
│   ├── 1A-Theatre_Square/
│   │   ├── cf_1A.cpp          ← your solution
│   │   ├── .problem.json      ← metadata (used by test runner)
│   │   ├── input1.txt
│   │   └── output1.txt
│   └── 1900A-Tricky_Template/
│       └── cf_1900A.cpp
└── templates/
    ├── template.cpp            ← your custom C++ template
    └── template.py
```

## CodeLens Actions

When editing a solution file (`cf_*.cpp`, `cf_*.py`, etc.), action buttons appear at the top:

- **Run Tests** — run all sample test cases
- **Import Samples** — import from clipboard

---

## Troubleshooting

**Problem statement shows a fallback page (403)?**
Enable `codeforces.enableBrowserExtraction` and configure `codeforces.chromeExecutablePath`. The extension will open Chrome, let you complete any verification, then extract the statement automatically.


**Tests not running?**
Ensure the required compiler/interpreter is on your PATH. Check `codeforces.cppCompiler` and `codeforces.pythonCommand`.

**Profile stats not loading?**
Run `Codeforces: Refresh Profile Snapshot`. Stats require a successful API fetch of your recent submissions.
